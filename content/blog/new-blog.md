This the first post on my new blog. I've decided to move away from [Medium](https://medium.com/@bakedidea) for a few of reasons:

1. Whilst i really like Medium, it'll run out of cash at some point or sacrifice its users to avoid running out of cash. So i figured i'd pre-empt this eventuality and move my blog. Over time i'll move most of my old posts here.
2. I quite like the idea of 'owning' my own content so to speak
3. Creating this blog gave me an excuse to try out creating a static site using [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and play around with some components of AWS that i haven't tried before (i'll probably blog about this soon)
4. I wanted to create more of a single online presence, bringing together lots of the various bits of content i've produced, whether blog posts, t-shirts, ebooks, songs, etc

I'll see how it goes, who knows i might get bored of doing the basic admin of the site and move back to medium, or go for a non-static platform, for now this will do.
blah blah
